I am a researcher in paleoclimate modelling at the Department of Geological Sciences, Stockholm University. I am interested in reconstructing the climate during the Eocene-Oligocene Transition. This was a major climate transition 34 million years ago when the Antarctic ice sheet first formed. There were also major changes to the ocean circulation around this time, due to opening of the Southern Ocean gateways, and our recent work shows that Arctic gateways also had a large impact on the deep circulation of the Atlantic at this time.

I am also developing simulations of the early Eocene, 55 million years ago, in collaboration with the DeepMIP project. I was recently awarded a FORMAS mobility grant to develop an early Oligocene simulation (30 million years ago), to further investigate the impacts of gateway evolution across the Eocene-Oligocene. I am interested in developing new methods to explain proxies of deep circulation, in particular Neodymium isotopes which record the deep circulation in the Pacific through the Cenozoic.
