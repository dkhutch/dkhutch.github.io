Just had a really nice 1 week visit to the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research, Utrecht (IMAU), working on collaborations with Michiel Baatsen and Anna von der Heydt. I really enjoyed the stay, and the whole group was really welcoming. Had my first taste of commuting to work by bicycle, Dutch-style. This was an eye-opener: heavy bike traffic, requiring constant vigilance and consideration of the multiple streams of riders crammed into narrow lanes. You definitely feel a safety in numbers that is hard to replicate anywhere else in the world.

As a fun aside, Michiel and I made a video of the plate tectonic evolution from 64 Ma to present:

This displays only modern day topography on top of plate tectonic motion - there are no reconstructions of actual paleoelevations or shorelines. But it's fun to watch, and unlike many plate tectonic videos I've seen, it has a really high frame rate! The continents really look like they are gliding rather than iteratively jumping from frame to frame. 

One could also dig a bit more into getting the missing seafloor depths, and focusing on the South Pole for instance. But it's a nice start.
