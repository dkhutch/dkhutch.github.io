I am a postdoctoral researcher in paleoclimate modelling at the Department of Geological Sciences, Stockholm University. I am interested in reconstructing the climate during the Eocene-Oligocene Transition. This was a major climate transition 34 million years ago when the Antarctic ice sheet first formed. There were also major changes to the ocean circulation around this time, due to important ocean gateway changes such as Drake Passage and the Tasman Seaway. 

I am also interested in modern day climate problems. My PhD investigated why the Northern Hemisphere is warming at a faster rate than the Southern Hemisphere. I found that ocean currents play an important role in setting this asymmetry, in particular the Antarctic Circumpolar Current helps to delay the Southern Hemisphere from warming.
